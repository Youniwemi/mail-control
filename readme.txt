== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I track Email Opening and clicks? =

If your recipient receives your email, don't you want to know? Is it in his spam folder? Is the email subject clear enough that he actually opens the email? is your call to action compeling enough so he clicks on it?

What if you notice that a visitor reads you email multiple times? isn't it a good indicator that he is interested in what you are selling? maybe you should contact him again...

= Where can I get support? =

If you get stuck, you can ask for help in the [Mail Control Plugin Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/mail-control).

= Will Mail Control work with my theme and other plugins ? =

Probably, as long as your theme or plugin doesn't override the wp_mail function. Mail Control should work just fine
